# 💥 Penetration Testing of a Banking Web Application

*(Metasploit & Nessus)*

## Overview

This project simulates a **web application penetration test** against a vulnerable banking service provider environment. The assessment was conducted in a **controlled lab setting** using industry-standard tools to identify, exploit, and analyse common web vulnerabilities.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **offensive security fundamentals**, vulnerability assessment, exploitation techniques, and remediation awareness.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project was performed strictly in a legal, isolated lab environment for educational purposes only.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Kali Linux**
* **Metasploit Framework**
* **Nessus Vulnerability Scanner**
* **Oracle VirtualBox**
* **OWASP Broken Web Applications / Bitnami WordPress VM**

---

## Objectives

* Perform **vulnerability assessment** using Nessus
* Identify and validate **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities
* Exploit identified weaknesses using **Metasploit** and supporting tools
* Demonstrate **post-exploitation activities** (shell access, file retrieval)
* Analyse risks and recommend **mitigation strategies**

---

## Key Findings

### Identified Vulnerabilities

* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Outdated web server and CMS components

### Exploitation Summary

* SQL Injection exploited to extract sensitive data
* XSS leveraged to demonstrate session compromise risks
* Metasploit modules used to exploit known WordPress plugin vulnerabilities

---

## Mitigation & Recommendations

* Apply **input validation and output encoding**
* Patch and update CMS components and plugins
* Implement **least-privilege access controls**
* Deploy **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** protections
* Conduct regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Conducted an **end-to-end penetration testing workflow**
* Gained hands-on experience with **Nessus and Metasploit**
* Strengthened understanding of **web application attack vectors**
* Improved ability to communicate findings and remediation clearly
* Developed ethical awareness of responsible security testing
